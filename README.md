# Atmos (DEPRECATED, USE A REAL DISCORD BOT)
> **While we'd like to believe what we created here was useful at the time, it was more for learning purposes than public usability. If you need a real self-hosted discord bot, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. No support will be provided for this bot.**
